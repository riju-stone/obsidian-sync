# Obsidian Sync
Sync obsidian vaults across all your devices

## About
This is a plugin which can be used with obsidian to sync you notes and documents across different devices.
This was created to bypass their idiotic $4 monthy subscription model.

You can sign in using any of the three accounts - 
* Google Account
* Microsoft Account
* Apple ID

This plugin uses firebase authentication and firebase store to keep all the files synced across all your devices.

`Please Note` - All your documents and notes will be stored in a _self-hosted_ firebase instance. **Your data is your responsibility.**


> This project is under active development. I will update the Readme with more details on how to install the plugin on all of you devices and how to setup your own instance of firebase soon...
